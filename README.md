Character level GPT implemented in pytorch

MiniGPT is a decoder-only model implemented in pytorch.
It was trained on the Mini Shakespeare dataset and generates the next token based on the previously generated tokens.

While the model and dataset used are too small for the model to actually generate sentences that make sense,
It generates sequences that sound very much like dialogues from a Shakespeare play.

A generated sequence (after 5000 iterations of training) is shown below:
```
CLARENCE:
The duke hath power to Pomfret, and Warwick,
Will I be reverent to wield my son,
And ten thus my son, and my oath both,
With my lord, farewell! Well, these Plantageneto,
Who bade me of ware deadly wonder divine?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why, she's on the house of Buckolia?

KING RICHARD III:
Bfasting of all death in woe?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Reign, now I am not spoke of arch.
But in the bloody arm of heaven,
To frame women live on other shall beguile:
Which not, the steers, dispatch'd, with themselves,
But in the leash of all their fears dreams,
They call them breathed when they do approach:
Are they are but graced their eyes of your country;
Which we can show us as a name,
Dry 'doves yourselves;' and, if you reconciled,
As iclear you high to piery foes, you
We have at all, Edmiose to your friends,
And much cause of your partners
Of your proper tried in summer's hook,
But bear the poor horrow-hear me,
Which doth ave mine honour weeds, drawm in your love?
